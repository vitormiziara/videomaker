description: Phase 3 of the Maestro Video Generator pipeline. Generate a 1080x1920 HeyGen avatar video from the PT-BR script using YOUR avatar (config.avatar.*). The ONLY method is the AI Studio browser editor (/create-v4) driven by Playwright MCP — it uses the subscription credits (no extra cost). There is no other generation path. Triggers — "generate heygen video", "create avatar video", "run heygen", "make the avatar speak the script".

Precondition: `config/config.json` has `setup.completed: true` (run `/setup` otherwise).

# Skill: generate-avatar-heygen (Phase 3 — HeyGen Avatar)

**Read `heygen-pipeline/HEYGEN_INSTRUCTIONS.md` before running** — it carries the full, verified browser workflow with current selectors. There is exactly ONE method: the AI Studio browser editor (`/create-v4`) via Playwright MCP.

## WHY BROWSER (no extra cost)
The browser AI Studio editor uses the monthly subscription credits (example plan: AvatarIV = 20 credits/min, ~2000/mo ≈ ~100 short videos), so a short video is effectively free. A 55s clip drew ~19 credits. This is the only sanctioned generation path — drive it with Playwright MCP.

## INPUTS
- `<downloads>/<VideoName>_script.txt` (in `config.brand.language` — PT-BR by default — written with the `Write` tool, accents intact).
- Avatar: **ONE avatar per repo — `config.avatar.name`** (look `config.avatar.look` primary, `config.avatar.fallback_look` fallback). Never switch avatars mid-run. Voice `config.avatar.voice` auto-applies (it is bound to the avatar).

## OUTPUTS
- `<downloads>/Quick-Avatar-Video-1080p.mp4` (1080x1920, H.264 + AAC) — the raw download/pad target.
- **`<downloads>/<VideoName>_avatar_1080p.mp4` — the PER-RUN canonical avatar (QCR-180). Every downstream phase reads THIS, never the shared `Quick-Avatar` path.**
- The Avatar IV V4 export is **1080×1906** — pad to 1920. **Avatar III/V export native 1080×1920 — pad is a no-op; ffprobe the height FIRST and `cp` instead of re-encoding when it's already 1920 (skips a ~2-min re-encode; conditional command in HEYGEN_INSTRUCTIONS.md step 10).**
- **Evidence gate:** `ffprobe` MUST show `h264 / 1080x1920 / aac` before Phase 4.

## PER-RUN AVATAR ISOLATION (MANDATORY — QCR-180)
The shared fixed path `<downloads>/Quick-Avatar-Video-1080p.mp4` is overwritten by every run and was the root cause of a real cross-run contamination incident (a wrong/stale avatar at that path got embedded while the SRT+subtitles+motion belonged to the correct run). To make cross-run contamination structurally impossible:
1. **BEFORE the HeyGen download:** delete any stale shared file so a leftover can't be grabbed —
   `rm -f <downloads>/Quick-Avatar-Video-1080p.mp4`.
2. **IMMEDIATELY AFTER padding + the ffprobe gate passes:** copy to the per-run name and from then on reference ONLY it —
   `cp <downloads>/Quick-Avatar-Video-1080p.mp4 <downloads>/<VideoName>_avatar_1080p.mp4`.
3. Phase 4 (motion) copies the avatar into the Remotion project (`motion-pipeline/remotion-agent`) FROM `<downloads>/<VideoName>_avatar_1080p.mp4` — never from the shared path.
4. The Phase-3 SRT MUST be transcribed from `<downloads>/<VideoName>_avatar_1080p.mp4` (this run's avatar), and the audio↔subtitle gate (QCR-180, in `generate-subtitles` Step 0 and — when `config.qc.enabled` — `qc-gate-gemini` Step 0) re-verifies the embedded audio matches that SRT after the render.

## THE METHOD: browser AI Studio (Playwright MCP)
Full step-by-step in `heygen-pipeline/HEYGEN_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. Summary:
1. `browser_navigate` → `https://app.heygen.com/home` (login persists; if prompted: Use email → `<HEYGEN_EMAIL>` → Use password → `<HEYGEN_PASSWORD>` (from `.claude/keys.md` `## HeyGen`) → Log in; Cloudflare auto-clears; STOP on 2FA/captcha).
2. Home → **"Start from Scratch — Go to AI Studio"** → **"New video"** → `/create-v4` editor (close Brand Systems promo).
3. Click **"Portrait (9:16)"**.
4. Avatar selector → group header → **Recently Used / My Avatars → `<AVATAR_NAME>`** → look **`<AVATAR_LOOK>`** (click the card, not the overlay-covered img — QCR-110/QCR-125).
5. `browser_type` (fill) the script into the Script textbox. **If the box already has text (swapping a script), clear it first (focus → `ControlOrMeta+a` → `Delete`) — fill APPENDS to the rich-text box, it does not replace (QCR-032). Verify the duration estimate reflects ONE script (~60s, not ~130s) before Generate.**
6. **Generate** → dialog: 1080p / MP4 / Watermark Off / "uses N credits" → **Submit** → "Video submitted".
   - **OUT-OF-CREDITS → SWITCH TO AVATAR III, NEVER ESCALATE (QCR-154).** If the dialog says the Avatar IV cost EXCEEDS the remaining balance (e.g. *"will use 24 credits. You have 1 remaining"*) and **Submit is DISABLED**, do NOT ask, do NOT pause, do NOT click "Get credits" (that spends money). Click **"Switch to Avatar III"** (`config.avatar.engine_fallback`) — Submit becomes ENABLED at $0 (subscription-covered), the SAME avatar / look / voice carry over (only the motion engine changes), it exports native 1080×1920, and (when QC is enabled) it passes QC normally. This is the VIABLE-FALLBACK-FIRST rule (`PIPELINE_DIRECTIVES.md` §7): an unsupervised run takes the free resource-at-hand option automatically. Escalate ONLY if Avatar III ALSO cannot submit.
7. Wait on `/projects` (~15–30 min), Download → move to `<downloads>/Quick-Avatar-Video-1080p.mp4` → pad 1906→1920 → ffprobe gate → **`cp` to the per-run `<downloads>/<VideoName>_avatar_1080p.mp4` (QCR-180, see PER-RUN AVATAR ISOLATION above).**

## ENGINE FALLBACK — Avatar IV out of credits is NOT a hard blocker (QCR-154)
The Generate dialog defaults to **Avatar IV**, which draws premium subscription credits. When those are exhausted, the dialog offers **"Switch to Avatar III"** — the included/cheaper engine that renders the same avatar at $0. An unsupervised run MUST take this automatically (see step 6 + `PIPELINE_DIRECTIVES.md` §7). NEVER treat "Avatar IV out of credits" as a dead-credential blocker, and NEVER click "Get credits"/upgrade. A true HeyGen hard blocker is only: 2FA/captcha at login that won't auto-clear, a `VOICE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` on `config.avatar.voice`, or Avatar III ALSO failing to submit.

## SLOW RENDER
The browser render can take ~15–30 min. WAIT IT OUT — there is no alternative generation path. A slow render is NOT a blocker; only escalate if it never surfaces a processing card (QCR-096) or after an extreme wait with the user reachable.
