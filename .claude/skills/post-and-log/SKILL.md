description: Phase 12 of the Maestro Video Generator pipeline — BROWSER posting (runs AFTER Phase 11 settled the comment→DM CTA). Publish the finished video LIVE via the browser (post-browser-manual) to Instagram Reels ONLY, then append the run to pipeline-log.csv. Optional Metricool fallback (config.posting.metricool.enabled, Instagram only) if the browser session isn't logged in. Triggers — "post this video", "publish to reels", "distribute and log".
---

Precondition: `config/config.json` has `setup.completed: true` (run `/setup` otherwise).

# Skill: post-and-log (Phase 12 — Post + Log)

> **PLATFORM = Instagram Reels ONLY (house rule).** YouTube Shorts, TikTok and X/Twitter are not
> posting targets — do NOT post to them anywhere in this phase. (Where a queued source link came from
> is input, not output — it does not change the posting target.)

> **ORDER: the comment→DM CTA is settled in Phase 11 BEFORE this phase** — at the END OF CREATION
> (`maestro-video-pipeline`), well before the video ever reaches the post-queue. With
> `config.manychat.enabled` the ManyChat automation (`manage-comment-dm`) is armed + verified LIVE
> (`resource_cta.status == "live"`); without it the step is skipped and the status is `"manual"` (you
> deliver links by hand). `/post-now` only re-runs Phase 11 as a defensive fallback for entries whose
> status is neither. By the time you post here, the CTA keyword in the caption is backed either by the
> live automation or by you. If Phase 11 could NOT settle the CTA (dead session / unresolvable resource),
> the run is HELD (either the build never got enqueued, or `/post-now`'s fallback released it back to
> `ready`) and you must NOT reach this phase — never publish a video whose resource link isn't settled.
> Just confirm `resource_cta.status in {"live","manual"}` (when `enabled`) before posting; if it's
> neither, go back and finish Phase 11.

**Default posting = BROWSER (house rule).** Browser posting (`post-browser-manual`) publishes
Instagram Reels via the platform's own web uploader to your account (`config.posting.instagram_handle`).

> **🛑 METRICOOL FALLBACK POLICY — read before any fallback:**
> Metricool is OPTIONAL (`config.posting.metricool.enabled`, default off). A Metricool brand with NO
> Instagram account connected ACCEPTS an IG schedule (returns an id) but publishes nothing — a real
> account lost a week of reels to exactly that phantom "posted". RULE:
> - **Instagram → Metricool fallback ONLY on a brand that actually has Instagram connected
>   (`config.posting.metricool.blog_id` / `.user_id`), and ONLY if the resulting reel is verified LIVE
>   (feed/oembed read-back of a real shortcode).** NEVER count a Metricool *schedule* as posted. If no IG
>   path can be verified LIVE → **HOLD the run** (see Step 2 + the move-to-posted gate below); do NOT
>   move-to-posted.
> - **YouTube, TikTok and X are not part of this phase.** Do not attempt a browser post or a Metricool
>   fallback for them.
>
> **ALERT ON INSTAGRAM COOKIE/LOGIN FAILURE.** Whenever the Instagram saved cookie/login session fails —
> `restore_session.py instagram --check` exits non-zero, the `--liveness` gate lands on the dead marker,
> OR a login wall / account-chooser appears at post time — **immediately fire the alert**:
> ```bash
> python3 post-pipeline/alert.py --platform instagram --run <RunName> \
>   --reason "<what failed + what fallback was used>"
> ```
> (delivered per `config.notify.*`; always logged to `alerts.log`). Then proceed only with an ALLOWED,
> VERIFIABLE fallback (Metricool, if enabled, on the IG-connected brand, only if a LIVE reel can be
> confirmed) — otherwise HOLD.

> **LIVE PUBLISH IS THE DEFAULT. "POSTED" = VERIFIED LIVE, NOT "SCHEDULE ACCEPTED".**
> Browser posts publish immediately (public). Never fake green — the run counts as "posted"
> ONLY after Instagram is verified **live**:
> - **Browser:** read back the live URL (the reel shortcode tops the profile grid + portrait verified).
> - **Metricool:** a scheduled post (`draft:false, autoPublish:true`) is **NOT** "posted" — it is only a
>   *schedule*. It counts only after you confirm the post actually **published live** (the reel shortcode
>   is live on `@<your-handle>` via feed API). A returned Metricool `id` alone is NEVER proof of a
>   live post. **A future-dated schedule that has not published yet does NOT satisfy the move-to-posted
>   gate.**

## INPUTS
- The finished final video (QC-passed when `config.qc.enabled`) — prefer the LOCAL high-res `<downloads>/<VideoName>_music.mp4` (NOT a litterbox copy).
- The Instagram caption (in `config.brand.language`).

## OUTPUTS
- 1 LIVE browser post (IG Reel) + a new row in `pipeline-log.csv`.
- The final stays in `<downloads>` (the pipeline never deletes it).

## PROCEDURE

### Step 0 (PRE) — PRE-FIRST-POST DUP RE-CHECK (mandatory, QCR-216 — run IMMEDIATELY before the first platform post)
A start-of-run dup-guard is NOT enough. The next-videos queue + Playwright browser + platforms are SHARED,
so a PARALLEL session can be finishing the SAME run (its per-run state is isolated from yours). An
`in_progress` run idle ~10 min at Phase 12 is NOT necessarily crashed — the other session may be mid-post
(Phase 12 browser posting takes 10–15 min). A real incident: the run's log row didn't exist at run-start,
so the guard passed, but the parallel session wrote it 4 minutes later — BEFORE the first post — and BOTH
sessions posted → duplicates on every platform. Fix: re-run the guard right before posting, not just at start.
```bash
# RIGHT BEFORE the first platform post (and again before resuming any held Phase-12 run):
grep -i "<source_url_shortcode>\|<Name>_avatar" pipeline-log.csv && echo "ALREADY LOGGED → ABORT POST"
python3 maestro_state.py show 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"status".*(completed|done)' && echo "RUN ALREADY COMPLETED → ABORT POST"
python3 next-videos-pipeline/next_videos.py list 2>/dev/null | grep -i "<source_url_shortcode>" || echo "(no longer queued — likely already done by a parallel session)"
```
**If the run is already in `pipeline-log.csv`, OR its state status is `completed`/`done`, OR it has been
removed from the queue → a parallel session already posted it. ABORT — do NOT post, do NOT log, do NOT call
`next_videos.py done`.** If you posted before discovering this (race), DELETE your duplicates and keep the
already-logged copies (Metricool: `DELETE /scheduler/posts/<id>`; browser: post → ⋯ → Delete), leaving
exactly one copy per platform. Never resume a Phase-12 run without this re-check. See `active-rules.md` QCR-216.

### Step 0a — BUILD-CONFORMANCE PRE-POST GATE (mandatory, QCR-181 — run BEFORE any post)
A finished `_music.mp4` can still be a structurally-wrong build (a real run once posted with NO §1 headline + a silent premium→hand-drawn downgrade). Block those before they go live:
```bash
python3 motion-pipeline/check_opening_headline.py \
  --tsx motion-pipeline/remotion-agent/src/compositions/<Name>.tsx \
  --state pipeline-runs/<Name>.json
```
Exit 0 = PASS, proceed. **Exit 1 = STOP, do NOT post.** Either §1 renders no clickbait headline (re-build §1 with `<PremiumOpeningHook>`/`<HeadlineHook>`/`<PillHeadline>` and re-render), or the brief was premium-classic but the build silently downgraded to hand-drawn because the image provider was unavailable without alerting you (fire `python3 post-pipeline/alert.py --platform images --run <Name> --reason "…"` + `maestro_state.py set --field images_alert_sent=true`, then re-run the gate). The fallback build may still post once the downgrade is declared+alerted — it just may never be silent.

### Step 0 — Browser readiness check (decides browser vs Metricool fallback)
```bash
python3 browser-post-pipeline/restore_session.py instagram --check
```
`--check` is a **cheap cookie-presence pre-filter only** — exit 0 does NOT prove the session is valid
server-side. **The AUTHORITATIVE readiness test is the in-browser `--liveness` gate run in
`post-browser-manual` Step 1.5** (navigate Instagram's live_url, DEAD if it redirects to the dead_marker).
Treat the gate's verdict — not `--check` — as final.
- `--check` exit **0** + liveness **ALIVE** → run the **BROWSER path** (Step 1).
- `--check` exit **2/3**, OR liveness **DEAD**, OR a login wall at post time → the Instagram session
  lapsed. **(a) fire the alert** (`python3 post-pipeline/alert.py --platform instagram --run <Name>
  --reason ...`), then **(b)** apply the fallback per the policy (Step 2):
  - **Instagram** → Metricool fallback ONLY when `config.posting.metricool.enabled`, ONLY on the
    IG-connected brand (`config.posting.metricool.blog_id`), AND ONLY if the reel is confirmed LIVE (feed
    read-back). If IG cannot be verified live by ANY path (browser dead + no working IG Metricool brand)
    → **HOLD the run** (do NOT move-to-posted; see the gate below). NEVER schedule IG on a brand that has
    no Instagram and NEVER treat a Metricool schedule as a live IG post.
  Never silently skip without the alert.

### Step 1 — BROWSER post (Instagram only), LIVE
Follow **`.claude/skills/post-browser-manual/SKILL.md`** exactly (it has the Instagram UI steps).
1. Stage the file: `cp <downloads>/<VideoName>_music.mp4 ".upload-tmp/"` (MCP can't read `<downloads>`).
2. Restore cookies (`restore_session.py instagram --snippet` → `browser_run_code`), navigate to the uploader, VERIFY logged-in.
3. Upload → fill the Instagram caption → **publish for real** ("Share").
4. **VERIFY LIVE (mandatory):** share AT MOST ONCE (QCR-214 idempotency protocol in `post-browser-manual`
   — baseline the reels grid first, never blind-repost). Wait for "Your reel has been shared"; confirm
   it tops the profile's reels grid AND that **exactly one** copy of this video is live (delete any
   duplicate down to one 9:16 copy).
5. Re-save the session (`storageState({path})`) so cookies stay fresh.
- **Account target:** Instagram = `config.posting.instagram_handle` (the saved session must belong to that account).

### Step 2 — METRICOOL FALLBACK (only if the browser session is gone AND `config.posting.metricool.enabled`) — INSTAGRAM ONLY
If Step 0 / a post-time login wall shows the browser session is gone and re-login isn't possible, fire the
alert, then post via Metricool — **only on the brand that actually has Instagram connected**:

| Platform | Metricool brand | blogId / userId | Connected? |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Instagram| your IG-connected brand | `config.posting.metricool.blog_id` / `.user_id` | ✅ must have Instagram `@<your-handle>` connected — verify in Metricool before the first fallback |

**🛑 A brand without Instagram connected accepts the schedule and publishes NOTHING — never post IG on
it.** Host on litterbox, then make the Metricool call at `$SCHEDULE_TIME` (`saveExternalMediaFiles:true`,
`draft:false, autoPublish:true`):
```bash
PUBLIC_URL=$(curl -F "reqtype=fileupload" -F "time=72h" -F "fileToUpload=@<downloads>/<VideoName>_music.mp4" https://litterbox.catbox.moe/resources/internals/api.php)
curl -sI "$PUBLIC_URL" | grep content-length   # MUST be > 0 (fallback uguu.se if litterbox 500s — see how-to-post-videos.md §1b)
MC_AUTH=$(python3 -c 'import sys; sys.path.insert(0,"."); from lib.api_keys import resolve_key; print(resolve_key("metricool"))')   # keys.md ## Metricool
MC_BLOG=$(python3 -c 'import sys; sys.path.insert(0,"."); from lib import config; print(config.get("posting.metricool.blog_id"))')
MC_USER=$(python3 -c 'import sys; sys.path.insert(0,"."); from lib import config; print(config.get("posting.metricool.user_id"))')
MC_URL_IG="https://app.metricool.com/api/v2/scheduler/posts?blogId=$MC_BLOG&userId=$MC_USER"   # the IG-connected brand ONLY
SCHEDULE_TIME=$(python3 post-pipeline/compute_next_slot.py --auth "$MC_AUTH")   # near-now (now+5min) for a real publish; ids + timezone from config
# POST the IG payload to MC_URL_IG at $SCHEDULE_TIME, autoPublish:true, draft:false (payload in how-to-post-videos.md).
```
**MANDATORY after any Metricool post — confirm it published LIVE (a returned id is NOT proof):**
- **Instagram:** confirm the reel shortcode is live on `@<your-handle>` (Metricool post detail /
  IG feed API). If it did not publish → **HOLD** (do NOT move-to-posted).

Schedule IG **near-now** (not a multi-hour-deep slot) so the litterbox 72h host doesn't expire before
publish, and so you can verify LIVE within the run. If IG cannot be verified live → HOLD (gate below).
This is the safety net, not the default. (YouTube, TikTok, and X are not part of this pipeline.)

### 🛑 MOVE-TO-POSTED GATE (MANDATORY before Steps 3 & 4)
**Steps 3 (log row) and 4 (queue-done) are the irreversible "move to posted".** They run ONLY when the
video is confirmed **LIVE on Instagram** (the platform the pipeline exists to feed):
- **PASS (move-to-posted allowed):** you hold a real, verified-live IG reel — a shortcode confirmed live
  on `@<your-handle>` (browser grid read-back OR Metricool published-and-oembed/feed-confirmed).
- **FAIL → HOLD:** IG browser share failed/stuck/vanished, OR the only IG attempt was a Metricool
  *schedule* not yet confirmed published, OR IG had no valid path at all. Then: keep the run in BOTH
  queues (`post-queue.jsonl` back to `ready` via `post_queue.py release`, `next-videos.jsonl` stays
  `in_progress`), do NOT log a "posted" row, do NOT mark completed. Fire the alert and leave it for a
  later `/post-now` retry. The final stays in `<downloads>` either way.

This gate exists because a real account once treated a Metricool IG *schedule* on a no-IG brand as
live and lost a week of reels. Never again — **schedule ≠ posted; only a verified live IG reel unlocks
Steps 3–4.**

### Step 3 — Log
Append the run to `pipeline-log.csv` (script_topic feeds the exact-duplicate check) — ONLY after the
post is verified **live** (per the move-to-posted gate above; a Metricool schedule is not "live"). Record
the live URL / live-confirmed status. Note in the row if the run is HELD.

### Step 4 — Remove from the next-videos queue (queued link runs only) — ONLY IF IG IS LIVE
Only after the move-to-posted gate PASSED (IG confirmed live), the log row is written, AND
`resource_cta.status` is `"live"` or `"manual"` (or `enabled:false`), remove this run from the next-videos
queue so it never runs again:
```bash
python3 next-videos-pipeline/next_videos.py done --run "$MAESTRO_RUN"
```
This is a **no-op for manual topic/transcript runs** (they were never queued — no matching `run_name`).
Do this ONLY on full completion; a held / not-yet-posted run must stay `in_progress` in the queue (do NOT
call `done`). Spec: `next-videos-pipeline/NEXT_VIDEOS_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

### Step 5 — The final stays local (no archive, no cleanup)
After a verified live post, the final `<downloads>/<Name>_music.mp4` stays in `<downloads>`; archive it
wherever you like (optional) — the pipeline never deletes your media. Optionally tidy only the
browser-upload staging copy: `find .upload-tmp -maxdepth 1 -name '<Name>*' -delete 2>/dev/null || true`
(`find -delete`, not a multi-glob `rm -f` — zsh aborts the whole `rm` line if any glob has no match).
KEEP: `pipeline-runs/`, `pipeline-log.csv`, ledgers, the comp `.tsx`, the Remotion project's
`public/assets/<Name>/` + `public/refs/`. See `how-to-post-videos.md` → "FINAL STEP".

## DEPENDENCIES
- Browser: Playwright MCP + saved cookies `.claude/auth/instagram-storage-state.json`; helper `browser-post-pipeline/restore_session.py`; skill `post-browser-manual`.
- Alerts: `post-pipeline/alert.py` (delivered per `config.notify.*`; always logged to `alerts.log`). Fire on any Instagram cookie/login failure.
- Metricool fallback (optional — `config.posting.metricool.enabled`; `X-Mc-Auth` token in keys.md `## Metricool` via `lib/api_keys.py`; `config.posting.metricool.blog_id` / `.user_id` = your Instagram-connected brand). litterbox.catbox.moe, curl.

## Comment-CTA in the IG caption (resource is shared on ~every video)
The run state → `resource_cta.enabled` is `true` for essentially every video, so the **Instagram
caption MUST include the comment-CTA** using `resource_cta.keyword`, e.g. *"💬 Comenta **<KEYWORD>** que eu
te mando o link no seu direct!"*. Without the keyword in the caption/video, no one knows what to comment.
**The CTA was settled in Phase 11 (BEFORE this post)** — `status == "live"` means the ManyChat automation
for this keyword + resource link is already running; `status == "manual"` means ManyChat is disabled and
you answer the comments by hand. Confirm one of the two here; if it's neither, finish Phase 11
(`manage-comment-dm`) before publishing so no commenter is missed.

## RULES
- **PLATFORM = Instagram ONLY (house rule).** TikTok, X/Twitter and YouTube are out of scope — never post
  to them from this phase.
- BROWSER is the default for Instagram. **Metricool fallback:** only when `config.posting.metricool.enabled`,
  IG only on the IG-connected brand (`config.posting.metricool.blog_id`). Never post the platform twice
  (browser AND Metricool).
- **🛑 "POSTED" = VERIFIED LIVE, NOT "SCHEDULE ACCEPTED".** A Metricool scheduled post (returned `id`) is NOT a live post. A run only moves-to-posted (Steps 3–4: log row, queue-done) after Instagram is confirmed **live** (real reel shortcode on `@<your-handle>`). IG not verified live → **HOLD** (keep the run in both queues).
- **NEVER schedule Instagram on a Metricool brand without Instagram connected** — the post silently never publishes (a real account lost a week of reels this way). IG Metricool only on the IG-connected brand, verified live.
- **IG: share at most once, never blind-repost (QCR-214).** Baseline the reels grid before Share; before any repost (vanished share / square crop) reconcile the grid first; if a copy is already live the share succeeded → do NOT re-share; if two are live, delete down to one 9:16 copy. A lingering "Sharing" spinner is not a failure.
- **Alert on ANY Instagram cookie/login failure** (`alert.py --platform instagram`) before applying its fallback.
- When `resource_cta.enabled`, the IG caption MUST carry the `resource_cta.keyword` comment-CTA (see above).
- Live publish is the default; draft/hold ONLY on explicit request.
- Browser posts go live immediately (no 2h-gap scheduling — that spacing applies only to the Metricool fallback via `compute_next_slot.py`, `config.posting.metricool.gap_hours`).
- Verify media URL content-length > 0 before any Metricool post. Never fake green — only log Instagram once verified **live** (a schedule id is not live).
